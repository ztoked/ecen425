1- The program is using two different semaphores to access the same variable.
    It should only have one. They should also be calling get and give in both functions

2- I would do a get semaphore before reading its value and then give after assigning the value.
    This would keep it consistent throughout iValue's manipulation.

3-
(A) If the value is greater than 7, our largest value, it executes the default.
    It checks that first. If it isn't the default then it multiplies what it is switching by two because each word is two bytes.
    It then has a list of addresses that it goes to by the number in switch.

(B) It just does the same thing as an if else.

(C) The random valued switch would not be able to do the same thing as the consecutive
    because it would need to allocate tons of positions in list of addresses that would be for the default case.
    It would not be worth it. It would take more processing for the consecutive switch to do an if else though.
    I learned that it is best to use consecutive values for switch statements when possible.
