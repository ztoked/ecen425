1- Round-robin because there is no spec on priorities it can just cycle through all of the sensors checking their values

2- Round-robin with interrupts: the interrupts have priority but they do not have a queue. They just run the highest priority

3-
(A)
Terinary operator that returns the greater of A or B

(B)
    *** Advantages of Macro ***
    1- Less instructions because it doesn't have to jump or save context. Faster

    *** Disadvantages ***
    1- Takes up more space because it is a direct text replacement
    2- Can change variables in unexpected ways (See C)

(C)
It double increments the max number. It is a text replacement so it would look like:
    ((i++) > (j++) ? (i++) : (j++))

(D)
It would end up changing the order of operations. It would look like:
    y + (1 * y) + 1 = y + y + 1

(E)
Just need to add parenthases around the x's
    #define square(x)  (x) * (x)

4-
(A)
    argWord = [bp + 4] = 0x4312
    argByte = [bp + 6] = 0x20

    localWord = [bp - 2] = 0x2103
    localByte = [bp - 3] = 0xB9

(B)
[bp + 2] = 0xFFEE = 0x02EA

(C)
[bp] = OxFFEC = 0xFFF6
